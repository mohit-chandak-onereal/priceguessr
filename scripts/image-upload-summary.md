# Image Upload Summary

## What Was Accomplished

1. **Listed all wiki images**: Found 54 images in `/Users/mohit/lab/projects/hackathon/resources/wiki-images`

2. **Analyzed database items**: The database currently contains 52 items, mostly different from what's available in the wiki images

3. **Created mapping scripts**: 
   - `map-and-upload-images.ts` - Maps images to items and generates mock images for items without matches
   - `import-wiki-items-and-images.ts` - Attempted to import items from real-data.ts that match wiki images
   - `upload-wiki-images-final.ts` - Final attempt to upload wiki images to existing items

4. **Successfully uploaded images**:
   - All 52 items in the database now have images (either real wiki images or generated mock images)
   - 8 items were matched with real wiki images
   - 44 items received generated mock images with category-appropriate colors

## Current State

### Items with Real Wiki Images:
- Omega Speedmaster → resized_Omega_Speedmaster_Professional.jpg
- Breitling Navitimer → resized_Breitling_Navitimer.png
- Seiko Prospex → resized_Seiko_Prospex_Diver.jpg
- Chanel Classic Flap → resized_Chanel_Classic_Flap_Bag.jpg
- Rolex Submariner → resized_Rolex_Submariner.jpg
- Audemars Piguet Royal Oak → resized_Audemars_Piguet_Royal_Oak.png
- Gucci GG Marmont → resized_Gucci_GG_Marmont_Matelass_Shoulder_Bag.png
- Herman Miller Eames Lounge Chair → resized_Charles__Ray_Eames_Lounge_Chair.jpg

### Items with Mock Images:
All other 44 items have generated mock images with:
- Category-appropriate background colors
- Item brand and name displayed
- "Mock Image" watermark

## Wiki Images Not Used:
46 wiki images remain unused because the items they represent are not in the current database. These include:
- Houses: Buckingham Palace, Fallingwater, Villa Savoye, etc.
- Cars: BMW M3, Mercedes S-Class, Ford Mustang GT, etc.
- Art: Leonardo da Vinci (Mona Lisa), Pablo Picasso (Guernica), etc.
- Grocery: Bananas, Broccoli, Chicken Breast, etc.
- Electronics: Apple Watch Series 9, Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, etc.
- And more...

## Recommendations

1. **To use all wiki images**: Import the items from `lib/real-data.ts` that correspond to the wiki images. The mapping is already defined in the scripts.

2. **Current approach works**: The database has all items with images now, which allows the game to function properly.

3. **Future improvements**: 
   - Consider standardizing item names in the database
   - Import more items from real-data.ts to make use of the wiki images
   - Update the mock image generation to be more visually appealing
